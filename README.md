# .NET Web API Middleware Usage With Exceptions

This is an example repository to show how we can use middlewares with .NET Web API and configure the exceptions endpoint by endpoint. When you open the SwaggerUI, you can test with some endpoints; 

- ``/tokenController`` is using the token controller middleware.
- ``/exceptionController`` isn't using the token controller middleware.
